# Instagram Data Extractor
This script extracts data using Instagram Endpoint. I created it to use for the pages which I follow. If you have some idea, we could add functions!

## Requirements
- Python v3.x or greater

## How to use it
Actually, this script request a .txt file with the hashtag list and return a .csv file with hashtags ordered by post number.

```
python3 ig-data-extractor.py hashtag_list.txt hashtag_output.csv
```
The default file names are __hashtags_in.txt__ and __hashtags_out.csv__.

### Input .txt file
The .txt file has to contain the hashtag without symbols, one under the other, like the example in the repository.
```
tbt
like4like
followme
picoftheday
```

## Why
I coded this script because I needed to get how "important" were the hashtags which I'm interested in.
